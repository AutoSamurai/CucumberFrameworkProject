# CucumberFrameworkProject

# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive test automation suite built using Cucumber, Selenium WebDriver, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. The project leverages Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles to create clear and understandable test scenarios using Gherkin language.

# Features
Behavior-Driven Development (BDD): Write human-readable test scenarios using Gherkin.

Selenium WebDriver: Perform browser automation for web application testing.

Page Object Model (POM): Maintain clean and reusable test code using the POM design pattern.

WebDriverManager: Automatically manage browser drivers for seamless setup.

JUnit/TestNG Integration: Execute and report test results using JUnit/TestNG.

WebDriverWait: Ensure reliable test execution by waiting for specific conditions.

# Project Structure
src/test/java: Step definitions, hooks, page objects, utilities and test runners.

src/test/resources: Feature files written in Gherkin language.

pom.xml: Maven configuration file managing project dependencies.

# Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

Maven: To build and manage project dependencies.

# Writing Tests
Create Feature Files: Add feature files in the src/test/resources/features directory.

Define Step Definitions: Implement the step definitions in the src/test/java/stepdefinitions directory.

Use Page Objects: Create page object classes in the src/test/java/pagesobjects directory to encapsulate web elements and actions.
